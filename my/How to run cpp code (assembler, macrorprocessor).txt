Excellent question 👍 — running your C++ macroprocessor program on Ubuntu is very simple.
Here’s a clear step-by-step guide to compile and execute it using the terminal.

🧩 Step 1: Open Terminal

Press Ctrl + Alt + T to open a new terminal window.

🧩 Step 2: Create the C++ File

Type this command to create a new file:

nano macro_pass2.cpp


Then paste your C++ code (the one I gave above) into the file.
After pasting:

Press Ctrl + O → press Enter to save

Press Ctrl + X to exit Nano

🧩 Step 3: Compile the Program

Use the g++ compiler (comes pre-installed on Ubuntu).
Run:

g++ macro_pass2.cpp -o macro_pass2


✅ If no errors appear, it means the compilation was successful.
A new executable file named macro_pass2 is created.

If g++ isn’t installed, you can install it by running:

sudo apt install g++

🧩 Step 4: Run the Program

Now run your executable:

./macro_pass2
